Autonomic is a modular operations management framework for building automated management systems.

Autonomicâ€™s theoretical model is based on the principles of autonomic computing for clear skies, full of radiant stars, but not for murky clouds hastily pieced together in quick-and-dirty languages.

Created out of curiosity and for personal use as part of ongoing transition to Rust for implementing infrastructure software.

## ðŸš§ImportantðŸš§
* No stable data model. It is subject to major changes without prior notice.
* Many components are not public yet or partially public.

## Core Design Principles:
* Modular and composable with optional modules.
* Concurrent from the ground up.
* Easy to use and reason about.
* Stingy with resources and efficient in execution.

## Implementation Highlights:
Autonomic consists of multiple modules that can be used to build an automated management system.

### Core Module
The core module has the following main components:

* Operation: Operations are **concurrent** and **independent** **execution contexts** that encapsulate metadata and execution logic.<br>
Operations are defined by implementing the `Operation` trait and managed by `OperationContainer`.<br>
The trait-based approach as opposed to using normal functions, allows more flexibility and extensibility with ability to make operations stateful.<br>
Each operation can have an optional `Sensor` that defines condition, when met, the operation shall be activated.<br>
Operations also support **dynamic runtime parameters** and can be activated with **different values** each time.<br>
It is up to the operation to decide how to handle the parameters, which can be **ignored** or **rejected** with an error message.<br>
Panics in operations **don't cause termination**, and they are caught by the container and dispatched as failed result.
However, when operation panics, it will be **locked** and no further activation will be allowed until manual unlocking.<br><br>

* Operation Controller: An API that manages access to operations on its node. It acts as a registry and namespace for a set of operations.<br>
When an operation is submitted to the controller, it is assigned a container instance that lives as long as the controller lives.<br><br>

* Operation container: `OperationContainer` represents the operation and controls its associated components.<br>
Containers are private and managed internally by the system.<br><br>

* Effector: `Effector` is the controlling wrapper around operations inside `OperationContainer`, and it is responsible for the activation and state management of operations.<br>
Effectors are private and managed internally by the system.<br><br>

* Sensor: `Sensor` is an observer that encapsulates an activation condition.<br>
Activation conditions are types that determine when an operation should be activated, and they are defined by implementing the `ActivationCondition` trait, which allow unconstrained definition of conditions.<br>
Pre-defined conditions are optional feature and users are expected to implement their own conditions using the `ActivationCondition` trait.<br><br>

* Service: traits that define services for specific components.<br><br>

* Data: Lightweight persistence framework that defines standard APIs to persist and query data using Rust's type system, regardless of the storage backend.<br>
It provides `DefaultStore` type that stores data in local database, but users can implement their own data store that works with their storage backend (DBMS or something else) by implementing `DataStore` trait.<br>
Data framework is currently work-in-progress and might be published as **separate crate**.<br><br>

* Tracing: Types and macros to support structured tracing of events.<br><br>

* Errors: Errors of the core components.<br><br>

* Shared traits.<br><br>

### Optional Modules:

The **current** optional models are:

* Service: Concrete implementations of services and other components to support building remote system services.<br>
Meanwhile, I have implemented an **OpenAPI service** with **router**, **server with TLS support** and **client** components, which was originally intended for testing since it is the easiest to change.<br>
The gRPC service implementation is considered for the future, but it is not a priority.<br><br>

* Events: Tracing and monitoring APIs that allow systematic storage and retrieval of events with a set of layers and services.<br><br>

* Operations (only **demonstrative** at this stage): Pre-defined operations for common use-cases.<br><br>

* Conditions (only **demonstrative** at this stage): Pre-defined set of conditions for common use-cases.<br><br>

More is coming as the project evolves.

Development is ongoing in the following areas:
* Data framework.
* Tracing and monitoring framework.
* Planing and management framework.
* CLI
